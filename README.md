# Cooltraption Playground

A coolbox for cooltraptions ðŸ˜Ž

Simple Multiplayer Game Engine.
The Core of the Engine is the `Simulation`. The whole purpose of `Runtime` is to properly hook up the `Simulation` with `Action`-sources and `SimulationState`-handlers.
This makes cooltraption very modular.
Rollback networking is still in progress. For now, a small lagspike can cause a desync (which is a feature of course).
